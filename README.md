# Hill-Climbing
The relative simplicity of the Hill Climbing algorithm makes it a popular first choice amongst optimizing algorithms. It is used widely in Artificial Intelligence, for reaching a goal state from a starting node (solution). Different choices for next nodes and starting nodes are used in related algorithms. Although more advanced algorithms such as Simulated Annealing or Tabu Search may give better results, in some situations hill climbing works just as well.
