# Hill-Climbing
The relative simplicity of the Hill Climbing algorithm makes it a popular first choice amongst optimizing algorithms. It is used widely in artificial intelligence, for reaching a goal state from a starting node (initial solution). Different choices for next nodes and starting nodes are used in related algorithms.
